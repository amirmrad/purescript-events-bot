### PureScript Events Bot (WIP)

This GitHub repository contains a PureScript library that provides essential functionality for creating and managing an activity bot. The library follows functional programming principles and offers different levels of abstraction using the Freer monad architecture. It utilizes purescript-run, which is an implementation of extensible-effects in PureScript, to enable extensible effects. Currently, the library is designed to work with the WhatsApp Client as the backend messaging platform. However, the architecture allows for straightforward customization of handlers and logic to support other messaging application backends.
